Overwatch + Rivals Script

----

Do you play Overwatch or Marvel Rivals?

If you do, and you're looking to spice things up a bit, I want to tell you about some leagues currently looking for players of nearly any skill level.

If you're like me, competitive is fun, but playing with randoms has its ups and downs and group rank restrictions can make it tough to even queue up.

Our community has been hosting a league for over a year now, and our goal is to give anyone the chance to feel like an E-Sports pro, even if they're as low as gold.

What we do is simple, we have 24 Overwatch teams, and 18 Marvel Rivals teams. You can join the community, make a post with some details about yourself and what kind of team you're looking for. From there, interested teams will reach out.

Our teams play once a week with flexible scheduling in a league format similar to other e-sports leagues. Plus, all matches are streamed on Twitch, and we average about 50 to 80 viewers, so you can get a taste of what it's like to play on prime time.

Many of our teams are recruiting right now and are looking for players to join their rosters. Both console and PC players are welcome, the only requirement is that you are at least 13 years old.

If you're interested, there's two ways you can join.

You can click the link in my TikTok bio and then click on the discord server "Spicy Esports"

Or, you can use our invite code on discord, spicyES.

Besides competition our community goes above and beyond to maintain a safe and chill place for all users, so if you also want to make some friends to game with, you won't be disappointed.
