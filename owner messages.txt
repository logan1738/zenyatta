Hello! I'm reaching out to all the team owners as we plan to expand our community to Marvel Rivals soon. I'll be giving each team 4 options to pick from for how they want to move forward. Please choose whatever you'd like, all options are completely fine by me.

However, just a note, if your team chooses to just have an Overwatch team or just a Marvel Rivals team, we may give the logo/name to another team in the game you didn't want to have a team for. For example, if you decide to have an Overwatch team but not a Marvel Rivals team, another Marvel Rivals team may be also given your name/logo.

Here are the four options, please let me know what you decide!

1. Have just an Overwatch team going forward.
2. Have just a Marvel Rivals team going forward.
3. Have both an Overwatch team and Marvel Rivals team going forward.
4. Have neither, and give the team back to the league.
