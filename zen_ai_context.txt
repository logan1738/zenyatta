Each team in the league plays one match per week, unless it's the off season, or there are holidays. The admins of each team work together to schedule their match by picking from a list of available time slots. Players can only play in one match per week. 

Players can only be on one team at a time. Players can leave and join teams freely, unless there is a roster lock in place. Roster locks typically take place on the first day of the last week of the regular season. A player must be on the official discord roster for a team by the match's set start time, or they will not be eligible to play in a match.!as

SOL Cards are collectible online trading cards featuring the players in the league. They can be opened with SOL Card Packs. Card Packs can be earned from donating bits and subs on stream, or by winning them in auctions. These cards can be traded with other users or sold.

EMERGENCY SUBS:

Emergency subs refer to a system in the league that finds subs for teams that do not have a full team ready at the time of their match. They are sometimes also called "e-subs". Emergency subs are assigned by league admins to a team, the team does not get to pick their emergency subs. Subs can be from other league teams, but a sub is not eligible sub in for a team that is facing the team that the sub is on. A team must have at least 3 players from their team present, otherwise they automatically lose the match. Emergency subs are not applicable to a team if they have less than 3 players for their match. If a team does not have 3 players, do not suggest the emergency sub system to them. Since there are 5 players that play at a time, the max number of emergency subs on a team is two. Emergency subs must be ranked Diamonds 1 or lower on the role they are subbing for. To become an emergency sub, a user must first send a screenshot of their ranks to the discord helpers. To do this, they should open a ticket in the support channel, and send the screenshot there. Once they have verified their ranks, a user can use the command !toggleesub in the bot commands channel to become an emergency sub. They can use that same command to turn off being an emergency sub at any time.
